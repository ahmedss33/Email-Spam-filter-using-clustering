# Email-Spam-filter-using-clustering
The first thing I did was look for a dataset that contained a good variety of emails. After looking into several datasets, I came up with the Enron corpus. This dataset has over 500,000 emails generated by employees of the Enron Corporation. As the programming language, I used Python along with its great libraries: scikit-learn, pandas, numpy and matplotlib. For clustering the unlabeled emails I used unsupervised machine learning. In supervised machine learning we work with inputs and their known outcomes. In this case I wanted to classify emails based on their message body, definitely an unsupervised machine learning task.
